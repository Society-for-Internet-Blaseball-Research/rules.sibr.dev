# rules.sibr.dev Changelog

## June 10, 2023

With [the conclusion of Blaseball](https://thegameband.medium.com/many-teams-one-goodbye-thank-you-for-playing-blaseball-2a5ecec378f7), we have adjusted several parts of our rules:

- We have relaxed our spoiler policy, and story elements from the game are now allowed throughout SIBR.
- It is no longer possible to abuse the APIs of blaseball.com, so that section has been removed.
- References to the (now-archived) Blaseball Discord server ("maincord") have been removed.

The `!tempcheck` command is now powered by [our bot aeguir](https://github.com/dannybd/aeguir).
